In order to add tiles in the app, you will need to add a JSON object into "tiles.json". Here's a template :

{
    "Name":"floor 1",
    "ID":"floor_1",
    "Path":"images/tiles/floor_1.png"
},

You will need to define the Name of the tile (It's not quite useful at this moment), its ID (must be unique !) and the path to the corresponding sprite.
